// Test Script for Property Approval Flow
// This file demonstrates the complete property listing-to-public flow

/*
COMPLETE PROPERTY FLOW DOCUMENTATION:

1. PROPERTY SUBMISSION (Frontend):
   - User fills out PropertyWizard form
   - Form data is converted to PropertyFormData format
   - Submitted via apiClient.createProperty() -> POST /properties
   - Backend saves with status: 'pending_review', verificationStatus: 'pending'

2. ADMIN APPROVAL (Backend Routes Available):
   - GET /properties/admin/pending - Get all pending properties
   - PUT /properties/admin/:id/approve - Approve property 
   - PUT /properties/admin/:id/reject - Reject property
   
3. ADMIN UI (Frontend):
   - AdminDashboard component accessible at /admin route
   - Shows pending properties with approve/reject buttons
   - Requires user.role === 'admin' to access

4. PUBLIC LISTING (Backend):
   - GET /properties - Returns only approved properties 
   - Query: { verificationStatus: 'approved', status: 'listed' }
   - Populated with landlord/user information

5. PUBLIC DISPLAY (Frontend):
   - HomePage calls apiClient.getProperties()
   - Shows approved properties in PropertyCard components
   - Users can search and filter properties

TESTING THE FLOW:

1. Create a test property:
   ```bash
   # In the client directory
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to /list-property
   # Fill out form and submit
   ```

2. Check pending properties (as admin):
   ```bash
   # Navigate to /admin (requires admin role)
   # View pending properties
   # Click "Approve" on a property
   ```

3. Verify public listing:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to / (homepage)
   # Check if approved property appears in listing
   ```

API ENDPOINTS SUMMARY:
- POST /properties - Create property (authenticated)
- GET /properties - Get approved properties (public)
- GET /properties/admin/pending - Get pending properties (admin)
- PUT /properties/admin/:id/approve - Approve property (admin)
- PUT /properties/admin/:id/reject - Reject property (admin)

ADMIN USER CREATION:
To test admin functionality, you need a user with role 'admin'.
This can be done directly in the database or by modifying the signup flow temporarily.

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Backend API complete
✅ Frontend PropertyWizard complete  
✅ Admin Dashboard component created
✅ Admin route added to App.tsx
✅ Admin link added to Navbar for admin users
✅ Property approval flow implemented
✅ Public property listing works on HomePage

READY FOR TESTING!
